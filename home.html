    <h1 class="maname-regular">The History of Basketball</h1>
    <p class="noto-sans">
      Basketball, one of the most popular sports in the world, was invented in
      December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor at
      the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.
      Naismith was tasked with creating a new game to keep his students active
      during the cold winter months. The game initially involved a soccer ball
      and two peach baskets as goals, hence the name "basketball."
    </p>

    <p class="noto-sans">
      In the early days, the rules of basketball were quite different from those
      we know today. Dr. Naismith's original game consisted of 13 basic rules,
      with no dribbling allowed, and the ball could only be moved up the court
      by passing. The first public game of basketball was played in 1892, and
      the sport quickly gained popularity, spreading to colleges and high
      schools across the United States.

    <p class="noto-sans">
      By the early 20th century, basketball had become an established sport with
      organized leagues and competitions. In 1936, basketball was included as an
      official sport in the Summer Olympic Games held in Berlin, Germany. This
      international recognition further fueled the sport's growth, leading to
      the formation of professional leagues such as the National Basketball
      Association (NBA) in the United States in 1946.

    <p class="noto-sans">
      The NBA played a pivotal role in popularizing basketball globally. Iconic
      players like Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird,
      Michael Jordan, and more recently, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, have
      captivated fans and brought the sport to new heights. The NBA's influence,
      combined with the rise of televised games, has made basketball a major
      cultural phenomenon worldwide.
    </p>

    <p class="noto-sans">
      Today, basketball continues to evolve, with advancements in training,
      strategy, and technology. The sport is played by millions of people of all
      ages, genders, and backgrounds around the globe. From grassroots programs
      to professional leagues, basketball remains a dynamic and beloved game,
      showcasing athleticism, teamwork, and the spirit of competition.
